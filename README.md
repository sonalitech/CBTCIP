Project 1 (Guess The Number)

This Java program, developed by Sonali, presents a fun and interactive "Guess the Number" game. Upon execution, players are prompted to enter their name and choose a difficulty level (Easy, Moderate, or Hard). They must then guess a randomly generated mystery number within a specified number of attempts corresponding to the chosen difficulty level.

The game dynamically adjusts the number of chances based on the selected level and provides feedback to help players refine their guesses. Players accumulate points based on the speed and accuracy of their guesses, contributing to an overall score. The program also offers an option to play multiple rounds.
